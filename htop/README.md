### Htop Wiki:

**Htop (`short for Hisham's top`) is an interactive process viewer for Unix Based Systems, developed as a more user-friendly alternative to the top command under the GNU General Public License (`GPL`).** It provides a real-time, text-mode interface, with a comprehensive overview of system processes in a tabular format, which includes columns for process ID (`PID`), user, priority, nice value, virtual memory size, resident set size, shared memory size, state, CPU percentage, memory percentage, time, and command.  

**It was written by Hisham Muhammad in 2004, he was motivated by the desire for a better process viewer than the traditional top command, particularly in terms of user interaction and visual presentation. The program is written in C programming language and utilizes the ncurses library to handle its interface.** Htop has a large user base and active development community and contributions are welcomed via its GitHub repository, where users can submit issues, request features, and contribute code. 

## Key Features:

- ***Ease of Use*** - Htop provides a user-friendly interface that simplifies the process of monitoring system resources. Users can easily navigate through processes and system metrics using keyboard shortcuts.

- ***Real-Time Monitoring*** - Htop offers real-time updates on CPU, memory, and swap usage, giving users an instant overview of their system's performance.

- ***Process Management*** - Allows users to manage processes directly from the interface, including killing, renicing, and tracing processes without needing their PIDs.

- ***Customization*** - Users can customize the display, including sorting processes, filtering results, and adjusting the layout to suit their preferences.

## Besy practice:  

- ***Monitor Critical Processes*** - Keep an eye on critical system processes to maintain optimal system performance and quickly address any issues.
- ***Customize Layout*** - Tailor the Htop interface to highlight the most important metrics for your specific use case.
- ***Use Keyboard Shortcuts*** - Familiarize yourself with Htop's keyboard shortcuts to efficiently navigate and manage processes.
- ***Automate Monitoring*** - Integrate Htop with scripts or monitoring tools to automate the tracking of system performance metrics.

  > Because system monitoring interfaces are not standardized among Unix-like operating systems, much of htop's code must be rewritten for each operating system. Cross-platform, OpenBSD, FreeBSD and Mac OS X support was added in htop 2.0.** Solaris/Illumos/OpenIndiana support was added in 2.2.0. htop was forked by several developers as htop-dev, and with support from the original author, the homepage was later redirected to a new domain. I am on version 3.3.4 as of writhing.
