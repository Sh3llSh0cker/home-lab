### Homebrew

**Homebrew is a free and open-source software package management system that simplifies the installation of software on Apple's macOS and Linux operating systems.** The name is intended to suggest the idea of building software on your own, in a similar way to brewing your own beer.

**Homebrew primarily focuses on distributing command-line software, which can be installed from the terminal. It is also used to manage various libraries and dependencies that these tools may require.** The Homebrew package manager may be used on Linux and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) 2. Homebrew was formerly referred to as Linuxbrew when running on Linux or WSL. Due to known issues with WSL 1, you may experience issues running various executables installed by Homebrew. We recommend you switch to WSL 2 instead always.

> Key Features:
Ease of Use: Homebrew simplifies the installation process for a wide variety of software. Users can install packages using simple commands in the terminal.
Large Repository: Homebrew provides access to a vast repository of software packages, known as formulae, which are maintained by the Homebrew community.
Dependency Management: Homebrew automatically handles dependencies, ensuring that all required libraries and packages are installed and up to date.
Customizability: Users can create their own Homebrew formulae for software not available in the main repository.
