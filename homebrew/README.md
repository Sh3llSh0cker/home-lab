### Homebrew Wiki:

**Homebrew is a free and open-source software package management system that simplifies the installation of software on Apple's macOS and Linux operating systems.** The name is intended to suggest the idea of building software on your own, in a similar way to brewing your own beer.

**Homebrew primarily focuses on distributing command-line software, which can be installed from the terminal. It is also used to manage various libraries and dependencies that these tools may require.** The Homebrew package manager may be used on Linux and Windows Subsystem for Linux (`WSL-2`) . Homebrew was formerly referred to as Linuxbrew when running on Linux or (`WSL`). Due to known issues with `(WSL-1`), you may experience issues running various executables installed by Homebrew. We recommend you switch to `WSL-2` instead always.

## Key Features:

- ***Ease of Use*** - Homebrew simplifies the installation process for a wide variety of software. Users can install packages using simple commands in the terminal.
- ***Large Repository*** - Homebrew provides access to a vast repository of software packages, known as formulae, which are maintained by the Homebrew community.
- ***Dependency Management*** - Homebrew automatically handles dependencies, ensuring that all required libraries and packages are installed and up to date.
- ***Customizability*** -  Users can create their own Homebrew formulae for software not available in the main repository.

## Best Practice:

- ***Clean Up*** - Regularly clean up old versions of installed packages to free up disk space.
     ■  `Command: brew cleanup` 
- ***Check Health*** - Regularly run diagnostics to ensure Homebrew is functioning correctly.
     ■ `Command: brew doctor`
- ***Use Taps Sparingly*** - Only add necessary taps to avoid cluttering your Homebrew setup.
     ■ `Command: brew tap <repository>`
- ***Secure Your Installation*** - Use Homebrew’s security features, like verifying GPG signatures of packages.
- ***Automate with Scripts*** - Automate routine tasks and environment setups using shell scripts to maintain consistency across systems.
- ***Document Custom Installations*** - Keep a record of custom and manual installations to streamline system recovery or replication.
