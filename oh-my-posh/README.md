**Oh My Posh is a highly customizable prompt theme engine for various shell environments, including PowerShell, Bash, and Zsh. It allows users to configure their command prompt with various themes and segments to display information such as the current directory, git status, system load, and more.** Traditionally, prompt tools work with custom scripts per theme (`just like Oh My Posh 2 did`) or a lot of CLI configuration switches to define what it looks like. With Posh, it starts from a single configuration file that could easily be shared anywhere, removing the need to really grasp what goes on underneath. 

**It was written by Jan De Dobbeleer and is actively developed and maintained by the community. The project is open-source and licensed under the MIT License, making it freely available for anyone to use and contribute to.** Oh My Posh is written in Go, a statically typed, compiled programming language designed for system programming. This choice of language ensures that Oh My Posh is efficient and performant across different platforms.
